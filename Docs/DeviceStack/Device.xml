  <title>Device</title>

  <para>A Device offers 1..n services over a network. Each service can offer
  0..n actions and 0..n properties to allow a user to change the state and be
  informed of changes in the state of the Device.</para>

  <para>Each service that a Device offers is represented in a Provider, and
  each Device can own several Providers in a 1:n relationship.</para>

  <para>The Device that offers your services can be represented in code using
  the classes included in the ohNet API:</para>

  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para><code>DvDevice</code></para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para><code>DvDeviceStandard</code></para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

  <para>The <code>DvDevice</code> object is not published by any protocol and
  is not accessible over a network. It should not be used to publish Devices
  over a network.</para>

  <para>The <code>DvDeviceStandard</code> object is used to publish Devices
  and their services over all the protocols supported by ohNet. You should use
  <code>DvDeviceStandard</code> to represent your services' device in the code
  you write.</para>

  <para>Code samples used in the following sections of this document show
  instances of <code>DvDevice</code> being used. <code>DvDeviceStandard</code>
  is derived from <code>DvDevice</code>. While Providers will operate on
  either type of Device, almost all clients of ohNet will find
  <code>DvDeviceStandard</code> most appropriate for their needs.</para>
