  <title>Actions</title>

  <para>A service's actions are represented in code by functions. Every action
  that a service offers is given its own function in the Provider.</para>

  <para>ohNet never treats an action as mandatory. ohNet does not require you
  to implement a service's action if you do not want to support it. However,
  some protocols will assume the implementation of certain actions is
  mandatory.</para>

  <note>
    <para>Clients using your Device's service may not respond as expected if
    you do not implement an action that your protocol treats as mandatory.
    Refer to your service's definition for the protocols it is published over
    to check if an action is mandatory or not.</para>
  </note>

  <para>If you choose to override the base Provider's function and advertise
  your support for the associated action, you must enable it in the Provider's
  constructor:</para>

  <programlisting>EnableAction&lt;action_name&gt;;</programlisting>

  <para>You must include the <code>EnableAction&lt;action_name&gt;</code> call
  for each action you want to define in your Provider.</para>

  <para>You then include a virtual function in the body of the Provider's
  class definition:</para>

  <programlisting>void &lt;action_name&gt;(uint32_t aVersion, &lt;argument_list&gt;);</programlisting>

  <para>Override the function by including it in your class
  implementation:</para>

  <programlisting>void &lt;class_name&gt;::&lt;action_name&gt;(uint32_t aVersion, &lt;argument_list&gt;) 
{ 
    //function definition here 
}</programlisting>

  <para>Add your own code in each function to provide its
  implementation.</para>
