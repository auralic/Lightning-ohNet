  <title>Device stack</title>

  <para>The Device stack has been designed specifically for use by software
  that offers services on a local network. It provides the mechanism used to
  receive and respond to messages requesting a change in a physical device's
  state.</para>

  <para>The Device stack uses a class-based architecture to present the device
  and its services on the network. The physical device is implemented in a
  Device class. The physical device's services are implemented in Provider
  classes.</para>

  <para>You use Devices and Providers together with the Device stack to send
  updates about the physical device's state to interested clients, such as
  Control Points.</para>

  <para>Details on how you use the Device stack and the Device and Provider
  classes are contained in the following sections.</para>
