  <title>Altering the Device</title>

  <para>You cannot add new Providers or change the attributes after a Device
  has been enabled. However, you can temporarily disable the Device to make
  required changes as required.</para>

  <para>You can call <code>SetDisabled</code> on a Device at any time:</para>

  <programlisting>iDevice-&gt;SetDisabled(aDisableCompleted); </programlisting>

  <para>This function takes a callback as its only argument. The callback
  confirms that all outstanding notifications of the device's disappearance,
  over all protocols, are complete. You must wait for this callback to return
  before you can begin altering the Device.</para>

  <para>When the callback later runs the Device is no longer available and
  cannot be detected. The Device and all of its services are removed from the
  network.</para>

  <para>You can now add more services by creating new Providers or alter the
  Device's description by changing attributes. </para>

  <para>When you have finished making your changes you can reenable the Device
  as before:</para>

  <programlisting>iDevice-&gt;SetEnabled();</programlisting>
