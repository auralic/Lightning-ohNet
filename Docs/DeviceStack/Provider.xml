  <title>Provider</title>

  <para>Devices offer at least one service, with each service defined by a
  list of actions and a list of properties. Each action and property is
  described in XML. The XML is used to generate code which a Device uses to
  receive, interpret and execute messages sent from a range of different
  Control Points.</para>

  <para>The generated code is called a Provider. A Provider is a class which
  encapsulates the service on the Device, turning the actions into functions
  and properties into member variables. Each Provider presents the service as
  an API that you can program to.</para>

  <para>Providers are generated as base classes which you must sub-class. You
  add your own code to for the specific implementation of your Device's
  service.</para>

  <note>
    <para>A high percentage of code for Providers can be auto-generated from a
    service XML file. If you need to generate your own Provider you can use
    the tools supplied with ohNet. See ohNetGen on page 12 for more
    information on generating your own Provider from a service XML.</para>

    <para>Every AV service from both UPnP and OpenHome is included in the
    ohNet library as pre-generated Providers available for immediate
    use.</para>
