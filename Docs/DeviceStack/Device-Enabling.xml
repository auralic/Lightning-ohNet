  <title>Enabling the Device</title>

  <para>You enable the Devices by calling <code>SetEnabled</code> on each
  one:</para>

  <programlisting>iDevice-&gt;SetEnabled();</programlisting>

  <para>The Device stack broadcasts the required alive messages to allow your
  Device to be discovered. Providers won't be advertised or discoverable until
  after <code>SetEnabled</code> has been called. Providers can be used as soon
  as the associated Device has been detected.</para>

  <para>This is typically the last thing you do after you have created both
  the Device and its Providers, and also only after you have set the Device's
  attributes.</para>
