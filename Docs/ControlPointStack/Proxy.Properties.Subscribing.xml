  <title>Subscribing</title>

  <para>You can subscribe to a Proxy to receive updates to properties whose
  values change. You must register the callbacks for the properties
  first.</para>

  <para>You call <code>Subscribe()</code> to subscribe to the Proxy: </para>

  <programlisting>// callbacks all setup by this point
proxy-&gt;Subscribe();</programlisting>

  <para>The Proxy will notify your Control Point application when one or more
  of the properties you have registered a callback for changes state on the
  remote device. This means you don't have to regularly poll properties from
  the Control Point application.</para>

  <para>You can update your application however you want when you receive a
  notification that a property has been updated. Typically you do this by
  querying the new value of the property.</para>

  <para>You can stop your application receiving updates to properties by
  calling <code>Unsubscribe()</code>. </para>

  <programlisting>proxy-&gt;Unsubscribe(); 
// none of your callbacks will run until Subscribe() is called again </programlisting>

  <note>
    <para>You can safely delete a Proxy while it has an active subscription.
    You do not have to call Unsubscribe() before deleting a Proxy.</para>
