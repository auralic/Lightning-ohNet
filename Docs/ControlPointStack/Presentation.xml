  <title>Presentation</title>

  <para>Presentation is the key to any Control Point software interface and
  ohNet has been developed with this in mind. The entire OpenHome ethos is to
  remove the focus from developing access to a device's services to allow you
  to spend all of your available time focused on what matters for you and your
  customer â€” user interface.</para>

  <para>The Presentation layer is not directly supported or discussed in this
  document, but ohNet greatly supports the development of user
  interfaces for use at the Presentation layer.</para>
