  <para>The primary goal of ohNet is to get you developing your Control
  Point application's user interface as quickly as possible.</para>

  <para>The ohNet code provides a library of instantly accessible APIs and a
  robust communications stack, saving you the time you would otherwise have
  spent hand-crafting complex protocol-specific messages such as UPnP's SOAP
  messages.</para>

  <para>You can now focus your main development efforts on producing extremely
  high quality user interface, providing users of your application with as
  seamless and enjoyable an experience as possible.</para>

  <para>From here the development of your Control Point application is in your
  hands.</para>
